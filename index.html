        <h1>What's the Weather like?</h1>
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Whether financial, political, or social -- data's true power lies in its ability to answer questions definitively. So let's take what you've learned about Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What's the weather like as we approach the equator?"</p>
        <p>Now, we know what you may be thinking: "Duh. It gets hotter..."</p>
        <p>But, if pressed, how would you <strong>prove</strong> it?</p>

        <h1>Part I - WeatherPy</h1>
        <p>In this example, you'll be creating a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. To accomplish this, you'll be utilizing a simple Python library, the OpenWeatherMap API, and a little common sense to create a representative model of weather across world cities.</p>

        <p><strong>Your final notebook must:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Randomly select at least 500 unique (non-repeat) cities based on latitude and longitude.</li>
            <li>Perform a weather check on each of the cities using a series of successive API calls.</li>
            <li>Include a print log of each city as it's being processed with the city number and city name.</li>
            <li>Save a CSV of all retrieved data and a PNG image for each scatter plot.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>

        <h2>Northern vs Southern Hemisphere</h2>
        <p>Once the data was pulled, it was interesting to compare the trends between the northern and southern hemisphere</p>
